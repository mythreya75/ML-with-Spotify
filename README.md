# ML-with-Spotify
Using Data Science and ML Python packages to determine release year of a Spotify hip-hop track based off of Spotify API's track features (danceability, energy, acousticness, etc.)

This project is predicated on the change in acoustics of the hip-hop genre over the course of 20-30 years. By using the track features of songs over the course of this timeframe, I want to determine what patterns we can find in how hip-hop has evolved, and how we can use those patterns to determine the year a track was released.

Packages
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Spotipy

Algorithms to try:
* k-means clustering
* Random forests
* Tensorflow Neural Network
